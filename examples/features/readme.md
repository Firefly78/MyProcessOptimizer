# Feature demonstration

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate ceratin features or workflow
from the `ProcessOptimizer` package.

Content here (both in this file and in the folder) is given in no particular order,
but hopefully with self-explanatory names.

## Independent variables
Control parameters are the independent variables that can be controlled in the
optimization. [Here](control_parameters.ipynb) is a notebook that
demonstrate how the control parameter settings are defined.

Control parameter settings can be [sampled](sampling_control_parameters.ipynb)
in different ways.
